# WebScraping-Extracting-PDFs-from-Website-and-text-from-PDF
Collecting the Telangana govt vehicle registration numbers information using web scraping on daily basis.

This project is all about extrating the vehicle registration information of Telanagana govenrment.
We can know the no of vehicles registered in a day for every registration office of 31 districts of Telangana government.

I have used BeautifulSoup to extract the district wise PDF information and pdfminer for extrating the text from PDF.

This information can be used to track the no of vehicles coming on to the road on a time basis.
This data can also be used to predict our desired registration number for your new vehicle. This can be achieved by using some ML algorithms which is a whole new project that will be shared shortly.
